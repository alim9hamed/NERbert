# Fine-tuning BERT for Named Entity Recognition

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to fine-tune a BERT model for Named Entity Recognition (NER). The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to preparing the data, fine-tuning the model, and saving the trained model.

## Features

* **BERT for NER:** Utilizes the powerful BERT model for accurate entity recognition.
* **Tokenization and Data Formatting:** Includes functions for tokenizing text and formatting data for BERT input.
* **Training and Evaluation:** Demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the model and evaluating its performance.
* **Model Saving:** Shows how to save the fine-tuned model for later use.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6 or higher
* PyTorch
* Transformers library
* tqdm

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `NERbert.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab (or a compatible environment).
3. Install the necessary libraries (if not already installed).
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

## Dataset

The notebook currently uses a small sample dataset for demonstration purposes. You can replace this with your own dataset for more realistic training.

## Customization

* **Entity Types:** Modify the `entity_types` variable to define the specific entities you want to recognize.
* **Hyperparameters:** Adjust the `batch_size`, `learning_rate`, and `num_epochs` variables to optimize the training process.
* **Dataset:** Replace the sample dataset with your own dataset in the appropriate format.
